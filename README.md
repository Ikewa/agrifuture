This is my website application caled the "Agrifuture", it is aim to promote mordern farming practices, bring a community of farmers together in other to help boost the experience of the farming pratices in a positive way, it is also to help young and new farmers get started. 
The website is at its a early stage of production hoping to have more versions of the website release in the future, the website is mostly front end as more legal and monetary issues have to be settled first to legaly kickoff the backend and that will come in the future with  some new updates.
To set up the website, which I hosted with github you just have to go to the menu of this repo, click on on the landing html file, open the file,
click on the raw button which will redirect you to anther page the URL; "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ikewa/agrifuture/main/landing.html",
you will replace the content in the URL in **bold** : "https://raw.gith**ubuserconten**t.com/Ikewa/agrifuture/main/landing.html, with **ack**,
which you will have the new URL as : : https://raw.githack.com/Ikewa/agrifuture/main/landing.html" and that is the lin to the website,
The link can be shared and be open in different devices but note that this website only has a desktop version as with later updates it will be available for diffirent screens.
